      <p>The Old Empty! The man is quite a character. He introduces bugs into software. He stirs up egos, often resulting in complete breakdown in organisation&rsquo;s communications. He is largely responsible for loss of direction in systems development projects. He is a spy. He is trickster. He&rsquo;s a whistleblower. But don&rsquo;t listen to his whistle - it&rsquo;s a false one. When he enters the room, silently, nobody pays attention to him. Vaguely smiling, he stands in the corner. Never speaking, he lets others argue and discuss. He attents all our meetings. He proofreads our reports. He&rsquo;s present in private conversations. He&rsquo;s a key member of senior management board. He volunteers for corporate retreats. And when the meeting ends, people leaving the room, he&rsquo;s still smiling, now grinning. Time has been wasted, money has been wasted, brains have been wasted. And people feel exhausted - wasted. Oftentimes, he&rsquo;s the smartest guy in the room.</p>

<p>Whatever, but you cannot complain that this man lacks vision. He&rsquo;s got lots of it. Always very open-minded and responsive to everything new, he&rsquo;s a vocal supporter of the latest IT trends.</p>

<p>The Old Empty, we Estonians call him Vanatühi in our language, is ardent supporter of agile development. He joins programmers to practice pair programming. He&rsquo;s busy shuffling tasks on Kanban boards. He can even do agile and waterfall at the same time. And when you unzip the big file the developer sent you - the project deliverables - and it&rsquo;s basically empty, only a handful documents of errant babble and some cryptic code files, when you know The Old Empty has been working there too.</p>
